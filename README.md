## My process
- I had to first go over the project multiple times to understand what was the aim and what i needed to do.
-Then i proceeded to start writing the HTML code .
- I then started adding styling with css then next was javascript.
- I used Javascript to first store whatever value the user inputed as income to localstorage, then for the add transaction feature i created an array called newTransaction where the name of expense and amount was stored,to display the values on the screen i then created a div with 2 paragraphs(first paragraph for name of expense while the other for amount) and one button for deleting the created div.
Then i created multiple functions for:
- Deleting transaction
- Calculating total expense amount to display on screen and
- Calculating balance.

### Built with

- HTML for structure
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript
